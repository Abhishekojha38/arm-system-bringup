# ARM Boot, Virtual Memory & Execution Modes

A hands-on, architecture-focused repository that explains **how ARM systems boot**, **how pageable virtual memory works**, and **how AArch32 and AArch64 differ**, using **clear explanations, diagrams, QEMU experiments, and real SoC examples (e.g. i.MX6)**.

This repo is meant to bridge the gap between *ARM Architecture manuals* and *real Linux/embedded bring-up work*.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

* Explain the **ARM boot sequence** from reset → kernel
TBD

---

## 📚 References

* ARM Architecture Reference Manuals
* Linux kernel documentation
* [how-the-arm32-linux-kernel-decompresses](https://people.kernel.org/linusw/how-the-arm32-linux-kernel-decompresses)
