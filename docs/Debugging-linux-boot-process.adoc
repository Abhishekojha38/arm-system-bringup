[abstract]
This document is about understanding how to decompress the kernel, load it into memory, and execute it. We build the QEMU ARM image by following the steps given in the `link:https://github.com/Abhishekojha38/yocto-playground.git[yocto-playground]` repository.

We will start this journey by analysing the zImage and understanding that how zImage is created.

|===
| File Name | Description | Path

| vmlinux
| An ELF-format binary. This is the original and uncompressed kernel image.
| ./vmlinux

| System.map
| A lookup table mapping symbol names to their corresponding memory addresses, mainly used for debugging and symbol resolution.
| ./System.map

| Image
| Generated from vmlinux using objcopy, extracting only executable machine code
(removing comments and debugging symbols).
At this stage, the Image is not directly executable because required metadata has not yet been added.
| ./arch/arm/boot/Image

| head.o
| ARM-specific startup code responsible for taking over system control from the bootloader.
The source file head.S is written in ARM assembly.
| ./arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S

| piggy.gzip
| The Image compressed using gzip.
| ./arch/arm/boot/compressed/piggy.gzip

| piggy.gzip.o
| An assembly-written object file that allows piggy.gzip to be linked with other objects.
| ./arch/arm/boot/compressed/piggy.gzip.S

| misc.o
| Contains the decompression logic used to unpack the compressed kernel image.
| ./arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c

| compressed/vmlinux
| A kernel image generated by combining System.map and other files.
Its meaning differs from the original vmlinux, as it is intended for the compressed boot stage.
| ./arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux

| zImage
| The final kernel image. It is compressed and ready to be loaded and executed by the bootloader.
| ./arch/arm/boot/zImage

=== ⚙️ Step 1: Image

`objcopy` is used to generate a binary file:

* `-R`: Removes the section named `.comment` from the ELF file (`vmlinux`).
* `-S`: Strips debug symbols.

[source,bash]
----
# Generate Image
arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-objcopy -O binary -R .comment -S  vmlinux Image
----

=== 🗜️ Step 2: piggy.gzip

The Image is compressed with gzip into piggy.gzip. Does this mean that if gzip fails, piggy.gzip will be deleted?

[source,bash]
----
(cat Image | gzip -n -f -9 > arch/arm/boot/compressed/piggy.gzip) || (rm -f arch/arm/boot/compressed/piggy.gzip ;false)
----

=== 🔗 Step 3: piggy.gzip.o

[source,bash]
----
arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc -Wp,-MD,arch/arm/boot/compressed/.piggy.gzip.o.d \
                -nostdinc -isystem  -DCC_HAVE_ASM_GOTO  \
                -DZIMAGE -c -o arch/arm/boot/compressed/piggy.gzip.o \
                ../git/arch/arm/boot/compressed/piggy.S
----

image::piggy-linker-script.png[]

The two labels, input_data and input_data_end, are used as boundaries (only the binary data between these two labels is what gets loaded).
From this, we can roughly understand that the purpose of piggy.gzip.S is to provide piggy.gzip to the startup code that runs before the kernel image is loaded (the name piggy implies "carrying on the back")

=== 🚀 Step 4: Bootstrap loader

If the bootloader is considered the first half, then the bootstrap loader is the second half. Its main responsibilities are:

* Initializing the CPU/SoC and the required memory.
* Decompressing the kernel image (if it is compressed; some bootstrap loaders also verify correctness using a checksum) and placing it in memory.
* Loading the decompressed kernel image.

[NOTE]
====
The difference between the bootloader and the bootstrap loader is that the former starts running as soon as power is applied and does not depend on the kernel, while the latter exists in the transitional phase between the end of the bootloader and the handoff to the kernel.
====

We can summarize the bootstrap loader flow as follows:

* When the bootloader hands over control, head.o (along with related files) takes control and begins processor-specific initialization (enabling special instructions or caches, disabling interrupts, etc.).
* misc.o locates and decompresses the Image using information from piggy.gzip.S.
* Other processor-specific initialization steps are performed.
* The Image is loaded.

=== 📝 Boot message

This snapshot shows the function used for decompressing the kernel image.

image::decompress-kernel-function.png[]

== 🔄 Initialization Flow

image::kernel-initialization-graph.png[]

=== 📋 head.S

We have already captured `head.o` in the previous step. Now we will see the assembly code of `head.S` and analyse it using QEMU and gdb.

The file `arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S` is the entry point for the compressed kernel (`zImage`). It is responsible for:

* **Initial Setup**: Setting up the processor state and basic environment.
* **Stack Setup**: Initializing the stack pointer for the decompression routine.
* **Decompression**: Calling the `decompress_kernel` function in `misc.c`.
* **Relocation**: Moving the kernel if it was loaded at a conflicting address.
* **Execution**: Jumping to the start of the decompressed kernel image.

After building the image we will launch qemu with the following command.

image::launch-qemu-with-gdb.png[]

Now QEMU is waiting for the GDB connection. The `-S` option freezes the CPU at startup, and the `-s` option starts the GDB server on port 1234. We will connect to it using the following command.

image::run-gdb.png[]

Connect the gdb to qemu by executing the following command in gdb 

[source,bash]
----

==== ⏭️ nops instructions

Execution begins in `arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S` at the `start` symbol. For legacy reasons, the code starts with 7 or 8 `NOP` instructions.

image::move-pc-to-next-inst-2.png[]

`0x40010000` is the `.text` section.

To understand the process in more detail, let's dive into the `vmlinux` binary and examine its sections and disassembly.

*vmlinux disassembly*

image::vmlinux-disassembly.png[]

To get more details info in gdb we will load the vmlinux at the right location which is our .text section.

==== ⏭️ ATAGS and Arch ID
`head.S` execution sequence jumps over some magic numbers and saves the pointer to the ATAGs.

Display R1 and r2 register values to see the ATAGS and Arch ID.

`Arch ID = 0xffffffff`
`ATAGS = 0x48000000`

==== 🛡️ Enter SVC mode and disable IRQ/FIQ

`safe_svcmode_maskall r0`  This macro is intended for forcing the CPU into SVC mode at boot time.

0x1d3 & 0xc0 = 0xc0 -> IRQ and FIQ disabled

NZCV flags are set to 0
----

==== 📍 Locate the start of physical memory

After saving the ATAGS and Arch ID, we will execute the decompression routine.So now the kernel decompression code is executing from the physical address of the physical memory where it was loaded.

The decompression code then locates the start of physical memory. On most modern platforms this is done with the Kconfig-selected code AUTO_ZRELADDR, which means a logical AND between the program counter and 0xf8000000. This means that the kernel readily assumes that it has been loaded and executed in the first part of the first block of physical memory.

image::find-physical-memory.png[]

once instructions are excuted, we know the starting address of the physical memory.

[source,instructions]
----
mov	r0, pc
and	r0, r0, #0xf8000000
----

image::find-phy-addr.png[]

`0x40000000` is the starting address of the physical memory.

The kernel image is loaded somewhere in physical memory, often by a bootloader (U-Boot, or in some old systems, Angel).The kernel doesn't know the exact load address yet. But it needs a base address for:

* Setting up the stack (sp)
* Copying itself to the proper location
* Accessing global data and relocation info
So early boot uses PC-relative addressing to calculate a safe "kernel base" address.

The decompression code needs a base address to work from, because it will eventually:

* Copy itself to the right place
* Set up the stack
* Jump into C code

[source,calculation]
----
0xf8000000 = 1111 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
Top 5 bits = physical memory block
Lower 27 bits = offset within the block
----

*So pc & 0xf8000000 keeps the first 32MB-aligned block of memory*

*Example*

Suppose kernel is loaded at:
PC = 0x400100a4
Compute:
0x400100a4 & 0xf8000000 = 0x40000000
0x40000000 → kernel base address
All PC-relative offsets can now be computed from here safely.

==== 📊 Calculate stack top address

. Below instructions are from head.S file which takes care of stack top address calculation.

[source,instruction]
----
adr r1, LC1
ldr sp, [r1]    @ get stack location
add sp, sp, r1  @ apply relocation
----

. To understand the LC1 label we will use objdump.

----
arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-objdump -D arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux |less

ADDRESS <symbol_name>:
   OFFSET:   MACHINE_CODE    DISASSEMBLED_INSTRUCTION
----

image::LC0-LC1.png[]

This instruction from head.S will be converted to

image::of-use.png[]

Now here current instruction address is `0x400100a8` and Value of pc during execution is `0x400100a8 + 8 = 0x400100b0`. Add `   0x200` to it to get the final value **0x400102b0**.

image::stack-location.png[]

image::stack-location-gdb.png[]

[source,instruction]
----
add r1, pc, #512    @ r1 = PC + 0x200
----

Here is the values of r1 and PC register before execution of first instruction. We can see that r1 address is `0x400102b0` which is matching with the value in the objdump output LC1: 0x000002b0

image::of-use-1.png[]

[source,instruction]
----
ldr sp, [r1]         @ sp = [r1]
----

Here is the value of sp register after execution of above instruction.

image::sp-before-relocation.png[]

At this point in GDB, we have just done the ldr sp, [r1], but not yet the relocation (add sp, sp, r1)
That's why SP = 0x9faa10 → it is the offset read from memory, not the final absolute address.

image::sp-after-relocation.png[]

Now we have the final absolute address of the stack.

```bash
sp_final = 0x009faa10 + 0x400102b0
         = 0x40a0acc0
```

Stack caluculation was bit tricky to undestand and that's why I am adding more details to it.

**LC1 and .L_user_stack_end Offset Analysis (ARM zImage Decompressor)**

`.L_user_stack_end` is *not* a linker symbol.

It is a **local assembler label** defined in `head.S`.

Instead, its value is derived from the end of the `.stack` section.

The LC1 object stores *relative offsets*:

----
LC1[0] = .L_user_stack_end - LC1
LC1[1] = _edata - LC1
----

At runtime:

----
real_address = LC1_address + stored_offset
----

This allows the decompressor to remain fully position-independent.

Important values:

----

.stack Size = 0x1000
----

Therefore:

----
.L_user_stack_end = 0x009f9cc0 + 0x1000
                 = 0x009facc0
----

*Symbol Lookup (nm)*

Commands:

*Stack Offset Calculation*

From earlier:

----
.L_user_stack_end = 0x009facc0
LC1               = 0x000002b0
----

Compute:

----

This matches LC1[0]:

----
009faa10
----

*Final Interpretation of LC1*

LC1 contains:

----
LC1[0] = 0x009faa10  -> (.L_user_stack_end - LC1)
LC1[1] = 0x009f99f8  -> (_edata - LC1)
----

At runtime:

----
sp = LC1 + LC1[0]
r6 = LC1 + LC1[1]
----

Which reconstructs:

* stack top
* end of image

without absolute addresses.

Final values for this build:

----
.stack Addr = 0x009f9cc0
.stack Size = 0x1000

.L_user_stack_end = 0x009facc0
LC1 = 0x2b0

Stack Offset = 0x009faa10
_edata Offset = 0x009f99f8
----

Everything matches exactly.

==== ⏭️ fdt_check_mem_start

Traditionally, the start address of physical memory is obtained by masking the program counter.  However, this does require that this address is a multiple of 128 MiB, precluding booting Linux on platforms where this requirement is not fulfilled. Hence validate the calculated address against the memory information in the DTB, and, if out-of-range, replace it by the real start address. To preserve backwards compatibility (systems reserving a block of memory at the start of physical memory, kdump, ...), the traditional method is always used if it yields a valid address.

0x48000000 is the fdt location passed as ATAGs. If we dump this location, we get:

image::../images/fdt-mem-check.png[]

first word is 0xedfe0dd0 which is byte-swapped magic number for fdt in fdt header.
----
0xedfe0dd0  -> 0xd00dfeed  ✅
----

image::../images/memory-address.png[]

==== Determine final kernel image address

* These are the instructions from head.S which adds the TEXT_OFFSET to the physical address(0x40000000).

We have the kernel base address now. Next step is to add the TEXT_OFFSET to it to get the kernel base address.
Then the TEXT_OFFSET is added to the pointer to the start of physical memory. As the name says, this is where the kernel .text segment (as output from the compiler) should be located. The .text segment contains the executable code so this is the actual starting address of the kernel after decompression. This is defined in arch/arm/Makefile.

-----
		/* Determine final kernel image address. */
	add	r4, r0, #TEXT_OFFSET
#else
		ldr	r4, =zreladdr
#endif
-----

image::textofs.png[]

image::../images/text-offset.png[]

For some specific platforms the TEXT_OFFSET will be pushed downwards in memory, notably some Qualcomm platforms will push it to `0x00208000` because the first `0x00200000` (2 MB) of the physical memory is used for shared memory communication with the modem CPU.

----
(gdb) info registers r4 r0
r4             0x40208000          1075871744
r0             0x40000000          1073741824
(gdb) 
----

`r4` = `r0` + `TEXT_OFFSET` = `0x40000000` + `0x208000` = `0x40208000`

so the kernel will be located at `0x40208000`

==== Setup page tables for cache only

Next the decompression code sets up a page table, if it is possible to fit one over the whole uncompressed+compressed kernel image. The page table is not for virtual memory, but for enabling cache, which is then turned on. The decompression will for natural reasons be much faster if we can use cache.

Set up a page table only if it won't overwrite ourself.That means `r4` < `pc` || `r4` - 16k page directory > `&_end`.Given that `r4` > `&_end` is most unfrequent, we add a rough additional 1MB of room for a possible appended DTB.

* Here r0 is the PC and r4 is the address with TEXT_OFFSET.

----
(gdb) info registers r0 r4
r0             0x400100c8          1073807560
r4             0x40208000          1075871744
(gdb)
----

==== sets up a local stack pointer

The kernel sets up a local stack pointer and malloc() area so we can handle subroutine calls and small memory allocation going forward, executing code written in C. This is set to point right after the end of the kernel image.

----
(gdb) info registers pc r0
pc             0x400100e0          0x400100e0 <restart+4>
r0             0x400102b0          1073808048
(gdb) 
----

Address of LC1 is `0x400102b0` and PC is `0x400100e0`. `0x400102b0` looks familiar, it is the same address as the stack pointer in the previous section where LC1 was calculated.

image::../images/stack-ptr-lc1.png[]

Now `sp` is pointing to the TOP of the stack

==== malloc() area

* malloc space is above the relocated stack (64k max)

----
/* malloc space is above the relocated stack (64k max) */
=> 0x40010118 <restart+60>:     add     r10, sp, #65536 @ 0x10000
---- 

----
(gdb) info registers r10 sp
r10            0x40a1acc0          1084337344

(gdb) 
----

`sp` + `0x10000` = `0x40a1acc0`

==== check for an appended DTB blob

This is not enabled in our case. CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB should be enabled to use this feature.

==== Check to see if we will overwrite ourselves

We basically want:

*   r4 - 16k page directory >= r10 -> OK
*   r4 + image length <= address of wont_overwrite -> OK
* Note: the possible LSB in r4 is harmless here.

*   `r4` = final kernel address (possibly with LSB set)
*   `r9` = size of decompressed image
*   `r10` = end of this image, including  bss/stack/malloc space if non XIP

===== Arithmetic Proof of Overlap

====== Check A — Is the final load address above the decompressor?

[listing]
----
Condition to PASS (no overlap):   r4  >=  (r10 + 16384)

Substituting:   0x40208001  >=  (0x40a1acc0 + 0x4000)
                0x40208001  >=   0x40a1ecc0

                0x40208001  is  1,075,871,745
                0x40a1ecc0  is  1,084,353,728

Result:  FALSE ✗  →  bhs NOT taken  →  fall through to Check B

Meaning: The final kernel load address (0x40208000) sits 34 MiB BELOW
         the top of the decompressor's working area (0x40a1ecc0).
         Decompression would write into the decompressor's own stack
         and malloc region.
----

====== Check B — Does the kernel fit entirely below the decompressor code?

[listing]
----
Condition to PASS (no overlap):   (r4 + image_size)  <=  addr(wont_overwrite)
                                   r10               <=  r9   (post-reassignment)

Substituting:   0x41b79d2d  <=  0x400101b4

                0x41b79d2d  is  1,102,552,365
                0x400101b4  is  1,073,807,796

Result:  FALSE ✗  →  bls NOT taken  →  fall through to relocation

Meaning: The decompressed kernel ends at 0x41b79d2d, which is 474 MiB
         ABOVE the wont_overwrite label (0x400101b4).
         The kernel destination range completely engulfs the running
         decompressor code.
----

image::../images/decompress-kernel.png[]

NOTE: Between the two snapshots the code executed `add r10, r4, r9` (r10 becomes
end-of-kernel) and `adr r9, wont_overwrite` (r9 becomes the safe-exit label address).
The registers change role — do not confuse the two snapshots.

===== Overlap Extent Summary

[listing]
----
Decompressed kernel occupies:   0x40208000  →  0x41b79d2c   (26,680,620 bytes / ~25.4 MiB)
Decompressor code + data at:    0x40010000  →  0x40a1ecc0   ( 9,957,568 bytes / ~9.5 MiB)

Overlap region:                 0x40208000  →  0x40a1ecc0   ( 8,290,496 bytes / ~7.9 MiB)

Verdict: The decompressor is ENTIRELY INSIDE the kernel's destination range.
         Decompression without relocation would corrupt its own executing code,
         stack, malloc heap, and page-directory scratch space.
----

==== Relocation Code Walkthrough

Both checks failed, so the decompressor must move itself above the kernel destination before inflating the image.

[source,armasm]
----
/*
 * r6  = _edata  (end of compressed data / start of BSS)
 * r10 = 0x41b79d2d  (end of decompressed kernel, computed in Check B)
 */

; Round the relocation destination up to the next 256-byte boundary,
; adding room for the relocation trampoline itself so it cannot
; overwrite itself during the copy.
add  r10, r10, #((reloc_code_end - restart + 256) & ~255)
bic  r10, r10, #255
; r10 = 256-byte-aligned base just above 0x41b79d2d
; This is where the decompressor will copy itself TO.

; Find the start of code to copy (restart label), aligned down to 32 bytes.
adr  r5, restart
bic  r5, r5, #31
; r5 ≈ 0x40010000 — source start of decompressor code
----

===== Why copy backwards (high address → low address)?

[listing]
----
Source range:       r5 (≈0x40010000)  →  r6 (_edata, ≈0x40a1xxxx)
Destination range:  r10 (>0x41b79d2d) →  r10 + (r6 - r5)

Since destination base > source base, a FORWARD copy (low→high) would
overwrite later source bytes before they are read.

Example with forward copy:
  Copy word at src[0] → dst[0]  OK
  Copy word at src[1] → dst[1]  OK  (but dst[0] might alias src[N])
  ...eventually dst pointer catches up and clobbers unread src data.

A BACKWARD copy (starting from _edata, working toward restart) reads
each word before the write pointer reaches its source location,
guaranteeing a clean copy even when regions overlap.
----

===== Execution flow after relocation

[listing]
----
1.  Decompressor copies restart..._edata  to  r10 (above 0x41b79d2d), backwards.
2.  Branch to the relocated copy of restart.
3.  Re-initialise registers for decompression in the new location.
4.  Inflate compressed kernel → 0x40208000 through 0x41b79d2c.
    (Safe: decompressor code is now above 0x41b79d2d.)
5.  Jump to uncompressed kernel entry at 0x40208000.
6.  Kernel reads FDT from 0x48000000 (passed in r2 by bootloader).
